However it is not offense, but his defense, that makes the Man-at-Arms such a vital member of any team. His ability to read the enemy's movements allows him to draw fire to himself to defend his allies and then retaliate with surprising force."

His power can neither serve nor comfort others; but, drawing on it, he can gain strength others can but dream of, or the endurance to bear what no other could. And when his massive blade falls, death's call rings loud to all caught in its thunderous arc. However, such force falls not nimbly, and foes may lightly evade their execution."
